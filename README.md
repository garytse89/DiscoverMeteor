# DiscoverMeteor
Playing with the sample project taught in the book Discover Meteor

The gist:

- Organize a Meteor project into client, server, and public folders
- CSS goes inside client/stylesheets and are minified
- Files are automatically located and loaded for you - this is a nice Meteor perk
- Handlebars template is used here in HTML, where the main syntax is {{#each}}..{{/each}}, {{#if}} etc.
- Template.myTemplate.helpers({}) (where myTemplate is the name of your template, such as postList) lets you define sample data and functions to use, the equivalent of an Angular scope function or model.
